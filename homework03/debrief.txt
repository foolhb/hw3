How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
About 20 hours

Would you rate it as easy, moderate, or difficult?
I think it's difficult for me. Though the code itself isn't super long, but I spent a lot of time in learning P4 and
code testing seems a little bit hard to me

If you worked with a partner, please briefly describe both of your contributions to the solution you submitted.

How deeply do you feel you understand the material it covers (0%-100%)?
90%. The only thing I'm not quite sure is some P4 language details. But basically I understand the workflow and the main idea.
